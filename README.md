This basically a project I am throwing together for my son. It is a simple MIDI
controller for GrandeOrgue. The goal is that he can control the stops on the
various organs he loads, so it is pretty generic.

In order to get the number of buttons necessary, I decided to use a matrix for
the buttons. Next up you just need an arduino that can function as a USB
device so that you can use the USBMIDI lib.
